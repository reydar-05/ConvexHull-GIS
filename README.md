# ConvexHull-GIS
In geospatial mapping (e.g., GIS systems), convex hulls are used to enclose a set of geographic points, such as the outer boundary of a region of interest.
We implement this project to form a convex hull between different major landmarks in India and as a part of our assignment in the course, Design and Analysis of Algorithms. We also find the 3 nearest neighbours from one chosen landmark.
